project_title: Role of Myocardin-Related Transcription Factors in the Smooth Muscle Cell gene program

project_goal: In this project smooth muscle cells from the human coronary artery were treated with
adenoviruses that express nothing (control group) or over-express myocardin (experimental group).
There were 4 virus induced and 4 control samples. RNA was extracted from these cells and
sequenced with paired-end reads on an illumina machine.
The goal is to test how over-expression of myocarding affects other genes and to analyse the
functional role of the affected genes.
